Model Development Documentation
1. Introduction
This documentation outlines the complete model development process, covering data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and deployment strategies. The goal is to support Security Operations Center (SOC) decision-making by providing accurate and efficient threat detection models. The following models were evaluated: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, each compared in terms of accuracy, computational performance, and memory usage.

2. Data Preprocessing
The raw data was preprocessed as follows:

Data Cleaning: Removed or imputed missing values, outliers, and standardized numeric features.
Feature Engineering: Created relevant features based on domain knowledge, including interactions between variables.
Data Transformation: Applied normalization and encoding as required for certain features, enabling compatibility across models.
Splitting: Data was split into training and testing sets, ensuring balanced representation of classes to avoid skewed predictions.
3. Model Selection
The following models were selected based on their robustness, interpretability, and effectiveness in handling both binary and multi-class classification:

Random Forest: Known for high accuracy and robustness against overfitting due to its ensemble nature.
Logistic Regression: Offers interpretability and low computational cost, ideal for situations requiring transparency.
Decision Tree: Selected for its intuitive structure, easy interpretability, and ability to model complex patterns.
4. Evaluation Metrics
The models were assessed using:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of predictions.
Macro and Weighted Average Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Evaluates model performance across classes.
Training Time and Memory Usage: Critical metrics for SOC integration, where resources are limited.
Each model's confusion matrix was also visualized for insight into class-specific performance.

5. Model Performance
The summarized performance of each model is presented below, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Model	Accuracy	Macro Avg Precision	Macro Avg Recall	Macro Avg F1-Score	Weighted Avg Precision	Weighted Avg Recall	Weighted Avg F1-Score	Training Time (s)	Memory Usage (MB)
Random Forest	0.94	0.85	0.91	0.86	0.95	0.94	0.95	40.31	618.74
Logistic Regression	0.86	0.72	0.62	0.66	0.85	0.86	0.85	44.22	414.65
Decision Tree	0.98	0.94	0.95	0.94	0.98	0.98	0.98	400.15	129.27
Visualization of Metrics: The attached bar plots and heatmaps depict comparisons for accuracy, training time, memory usage, and confusion matrices across models.

6. Findings and Model Selection
Decision Tree: Highest accuracy but relatively high training time, suitable for cases where accuracy is critical, and computational resources are sufficient.
Random Forest: Balanced performance with high accuracy and reasonable computational demands, making it ideal for SOC tasks with limited resource overhead.
Logistic Regression: Lower accuracy but interpretable and resource-efficient, making it beneficial for baseline checks or situations requiring transparency.
Given these results, Random Forest is recommended as it offers the best balance between performance and resource efficiency.

7. Deployment Recommendations
For deployment within SOC workflows:

Model Integration: Use the Random Forest model as the primary threat detection model, with logistic regression as a backup or validation check.
Real-Time Threat Detection: Implement real-time streaming and inference, deploying the model as a microservice to process new data continuously.
Future Improvements:
Optimization: Further tuning of model hyperparameters and dimensionality reduction can help reduce memory usage and processing time.
Regular Retraining: Periodically update the model with new data to adapt to emerging threat patterns.
8. Summary
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the model development process, model performance, and practical deployment strategies. For further scalability, the model can be deployed on cloud services, with monitoring frameworks for continuous evaluation and adaptation.
